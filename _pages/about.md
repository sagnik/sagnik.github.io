 I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Computer Science, UCPH](https://di.ku.dk/), [CopeNLU group](https://www.copenlu.com/). I work on the explainability of DNN models used in multi-hop reasoning systems, such as question answering, fact checking and natural language inference.
 
 Before that, I worked as an NLP/ML engineer at [Interactions](https://interactions.com). I developed DNN models for large scale entity extraction and linking, dialog systems, and sentiment classification. I also contributed to [a DNN library](https://github.com/dpressel/baseline) that was used as the ML backend for the company.

During my Ph.D. from Penn State I worked in the [CiteSeerX group](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index;jsessionid=DDB8AF927F0F126F814EB950D1ACB826) with [Dr. C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). I worked on information extraction from scholarly figures and tables, information retrieval and crawling.
