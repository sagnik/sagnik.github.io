I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/). I am interested in [thhe explainability of LLMs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3529755) used in natural language understanding tasks such as [machine reading comprehension](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/old_oct19/25.pdf) and [information extraction](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/csci5417/ie-chapter.pdf), particularly when used in the clinical domain.    
Previously, I was an NLP Scientist at the [National Board of Medical Examiners](https://www.nbme.org/). Before that, I worked at the [University of Michigan Medical School](https://medschool.umich.edu/) on information extraction models on clinical text and their generalization abilities + models for early dementia prediction. I came to Michigan from the [Department of Computer Science, UCPH](https://di.ku.dk/), [CopeNLU group](https://www.copenlu.com/), where I worked on the explainability of DNN models used in multi-hop reasoning systems, such as question answering, fact-checking and natural language inference.
 
During my Ph.D. from Penn State I worked in the [CiteSeerX group](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index;jsessionid=DDB8AF927F0F126F814EB950D1ACB826) on information extraction from scholarly figures and tables, information retrieval and crawling. Post Ph.D, I worked as an NLP/ML engineer at [Interactions](https://interactions.com). I developed DNN models for large scale entity extraction and linking, dialog systems, and sentiment classification. I also contributed to [a DNN library](https://github.com/dpressel/baseline) that was used as the ML backend for the company.
